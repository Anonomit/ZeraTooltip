<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Heroic tag now shows on ALL items which originally had the line in Wrath. This is enabled by default.</li>

  <li>"Will receive enchantment" lines on items in trade window now appear in the regular enchantment location. Why does Blizzard want to put them in between the gems and the socket bonus?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Level requirement "Max Level" option now checks that both your character is max level, and the item requires max level. Both are necessary for the line to be hidden.</li>

  <li>Improved line recognition in general, especially for green lines.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue preventing `/zt` from opening options when in combat.</li>

  <li>The Hide button now works for Races.</li>
  <li>Fixed issue with tooltip update throttling that could cause a tooltip to not appear under specific circumstances.</li>
  <li>Fixed a rare lua error that could happen due to uncached tooltips.</li>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Completely new config settings. Previous settings will be lost. Sorry! Back up your colors if you want to keep them.</li>
  <li>Customizable stat order. Because Blizzard can't seem to decide is Stamina or Strength should be first.</li>

<h3>Regressions</h3>
<ul>

  <li>Elemental weapon damage can no longer be colored separately from regular weapon damage.</li>
  <li>Most of the complicated non-configurable rewording is currently missing. This mainly affects set bonuses.</li>
</ul>

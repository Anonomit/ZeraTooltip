<h3>New Features</h3>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Spell Power default color has been changed slightly so it doesn't look as much like Shadow Damage.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Found a workaround for a missing event in Classic which was causing ZeraTooltip to not always modify tooltips the first time they load. It should be back to normal now.</li>
  <li>Many stats are now recognized much more reliably in all locales.</li>
  <li>Locked containers are now recognized correctly in colorblind mode, and also when the text is orange instead of red.</li>
  <li>Icecrown Citadel normal/heroic tokens no longer sometimes show the icon for the other version. This fix applies to all groups of items which share a name but use different icons.</li>
  <li>Tooltips for nonexistant items now use a specific icon instead of the one from the last item tooltip.</li>
  <li>Resilience is no longer visible in Classic Era.</li>
  <li>Expertise is no longer visible in Classic Era.</li>
  <li>Feral Attack Power is no longer visible in Classic Era.</li>

<h2>2.0.0</h2>
<p>&nbsp;LARGE REWRITE FOR WRATH</p>
<p>&nbsp;SETTINGS WILL BE RESET</p>

<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Completely new config settings. Previous settings will be lost. Sorry! Back up your colors if you want to keep them.</li>
<li>Customizable stat order. Because Blizzard can't seem to decide is Stamina or Strength should be first.</li>

<li>Many lines can be hidden from view. More than anyone has ever asked for!</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support ended for TBC, since it's no longer possible to play on a TBC client.</li>

<li>Elemental weapon damage can no longer be colored separately from regular weapon damage.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1.4.0</h2>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Classic Era (including Season of Mastery) is now fully supported!</li>
<li>Added support for food and drink items, as well as bandages and some potions. This is on by default, and can be disabled.</li>

<li>Weapon damage per second is reworded.</li>
<li>Hp5 and Mp5 extra calculations are now displayed as HpM and MpM instead of HpS and MpS. This should make it easier to estimate the effect of the stat in an encounter.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interface Options</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New option: Recolor usable effects. This applies to active trinkets, as well as consumable items like food, drinks, potions, and bandages.</li>
